# facial-expression-recognition
Developed a program for facial expression recognition. Designed and evaluated six different I/O algorithms for reading large files into vectors. Adopted an upper bound algorithm and improved the cosine similarity function computing time by 33 percent compared to brute force. Applied a partial quick sort algorithm to sort the k largest number in a time O(n + klogk).
